<h3>Handling</h3>


<p>Handle your phone with care. You may damage the phone or the battery if you disassemble, drop, bend, burn, crush or puncture your device. Do not use a phone with a damaged enclosure, a cracked screen or some other form of physical damage. Using a damaged phone may cause overheating or injury. Do not expose your phone to liquids, which can cause a short circuit and overheating. If your phone gets wet, do not attempt to dry it using an external heat source.</p>


<p>Your phone is designed to work best in ambient temperatures between 32° and 95° F (0° and 35° C), and should be stored between ambient temperatures of -4° and 113° F (-20° and 45° C). Do not expose your phone to temperatures above 113° F (45° C), such as on a car dashboard or near a heating vent, as this may damage the phone, overheat the battery, or pose a risk of fire. Keep your phone away from heat sources and out of direct sunlight. If your device becomes too hot, disconnect it from its power source if it is plugged in, move it to a cooler place and do not use it until it has cooled. Your phone is designed to work best at an altitude of up to 16404 ft (5000m).</p>


<p>Use of your phone in certain modes, such as gaming, taking videos, using a flashlight setting, or virtual reality or augmented reality features, can cause it to generate more heat than it would under normal operating conditions. This may cause your phone to operate in a reduced-power mode or temporarily shut down. Use extra care when operating the device in these modes. For more information on risks associated with prolonged heat exposure, please refer to the Prolonged Heat Exposure section below.</p>


<h3>Repair &amp; service</h3>


<p>Do not attempt to repair your phone yourself. Disassembling the device may result in loss of water resistance or cause injury or damage to your device.</p>


<p>For example, the device contains a laser that can be damaged during disassembly which might expose you to hazardous laser emissions which are not visible.</p>


<p>Contact customer service if it isn’t working properly or has been damaged. For more information, visit <a href="http://g.co/pixel/contact" rel="noopener" target="_blank">g.co/pixel/contact</a>.</p>


<h3>Charging</h3>


<p>Be sure the power adapter and phone are well ventilated when in use or charging. Using damaged cables or power adapters, or charging when moisture is present, can cause fire, electric shock, injury, or damage to the phone or other property. Do not charge your phone when it’s wet. Avoid charging your device in direct sunlight.</p>


<p>When charging the device, make sure the power adapter is plugged into a power outlet near the device and is easily accessible. Do not force this power adapter and other plugs or power adapters to a power outlet if space is not sufficient to accommodate both. When disconnecting the power adapter from a power outlet, pull on the adapter, never on the charging cable. Do not twist or pinch the cable, and do not force a connector into a port. If you receive a message while charging that instructs you to unplug the charging device or power adapter, disconnect the charging device or power adapter. Before attempting to charge again, make sure both the charging cable connector and the phone's charging port are dry and clear of any objects.</p>


<p>Only charge your phone with the included cable or compatible charging accessories, which are available on the Google Store or at Google authorized resellers (look for Google’s “Made for” badge). The AC adapter must be certified with a Limited Power Source output per IEC 60950-1 and/or classified PS2 per IEC 62368-1, rated: 5 Volts DC, maximum 3 Amp; 9 Volts DC, maximum 3 Amp when used with USB PD enabled AC adapter, and up to 11 Volts DC, maximum 3 Amp for USB PD 3.0 PPS enabled AC adapter and qualified per CTIA Certification Requirements for Battery System Compliance to IEEE 1725.
